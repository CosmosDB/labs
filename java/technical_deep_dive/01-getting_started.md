# Getting Started

In this lab, you will create an Azure Cosmos DB account.

## Log-in to the Azure Portal

1. In a new window, sign in to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. Once you have logged in, you may be prompted to start a tour of the Azure portal. You can safely skip this step.

## Create Azure Cosmos DB Resource

> You will now create an Azure Cosmos DB account to use in the remaining labs.

    1. In the **API** list, select the **Core (SQL))** option.

    1. In the **Location** list, select the **West US** option.

    1. Ensure the **Geo-redundancy** option is set to **Enable**.

        > With Azure Cosmos DB multi-master support, you can perform writes on containers of data (for example, Containers, graphs, tables) distributed anywhere in the world. You can update data in any region that is associated with your database account. These data updates can propagate asynchronously. 

    1. Click the **Review + create** button.
