# Authoring Azure Cosmos DB Stored Procedures using JavaScript 

In this lab, you will author and execute multiple stored procedures within your Azure Cosmos DB instance. You will explore features unique to JavaScript stored procedures such as throwing errors for transaction rollback, logging using the JavaScript console and implementing a continuation model within a bounded execution enviornment.

## Setup

> Before you start this lab, you will need to create an Azure Cosmos DB database and Container that you will use throughout the lab.

### Create Azure Cosmos DB Database and Container

*You will now create a database and Container within your Azure Cosmos DB account.*

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

    ![Resource groups](../media/04-resource_groups.jpg)

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Overview** link on the left side of the blade.

1. At the top of the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, click the **Add Container** button.

1. In the **Add Container** popup, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Database id** field, select the **Create new** option and enter the value **FinancialDatabase**.

    1. Ensure the **Provision database throughput** option is not selected.

    1. In the **Container id** field, enter the value **InvestorContainer**.

    1. In the **Partition key** field, enter the value ``/company``.

    1. In the **Throughput** field, enter the value ``1000``.

    1. Click the **OK** button.

1. Wait for the creation of the new **database** and **Container** to finish before moving on with this lab.

### Retrieve Account Credentials

*The Data Migration Tool and .NET SDKs both require credentials to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB account. You will collect and store these credentials for use throughout the lab.*

1. On the left side of the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate the **Settings** section and click the **Keys** link.

1. In the **Keys** pane, record the values in the **CONNECTION STRING**, **URI** and **PRIMARY KEY** fields. You will use these values later in this lab.

    ![Credentials](../media/04-keys.jpg)

## Author Simple Stored Procedures

*You will get started in this lab by authoring simple stored procedures that implement common server-side tasks such as adding one or more documents as part of a database transaction.*

### Open Data Explorer

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node and then expand the **InvestorContainer** Container node. 

1. Within the **InvestorContainer** node, click the **Documents** link.

### Create Simple Stored Procedure

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **greetCaller**.

1. Replace the contents of the *stored procedure editor* with the following JavaScript code:

    ```js
    function greetCaller(name) {
        var context = getContext();
        var response = context.getResponse();
        response.setBody("Hello " + name);
    }
    ```

    > This simple stored procedure will echo the input parameter string with the text ``Hello `` as a prefix.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``example``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button.

    1. In the new field that appears, enter the value: ``Person``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe the results of the stored procedure's execution.

    > The output should be ``"Hello Person"``.

### Create Stored Procedure with Nested Callbacks

*All Azure Cosmos DB operations within a stored procedure are asynchronous and depend on JavaScript function callbacks. A **callback function** is a JavaScript function that is used as a parameter to another JavaScript function. In the context of Azure Cosmos DB, the callback function has two parameters, one for the error object in case the operation fails, and one for the created object.*

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **createDocument**.

1. Replace the contents of the *stored procedure editor* with the following JavaScript code:

    ```js
    function createDocument(doc) {
        var context = getContext();
        var Container = context.getContainer();
        var accepted = Container.createDocument(
            Container.getSelfLink(),
            doc,
            function (err, newDoc) {
                if (err) throw new Error('Error' + err.message);
                context.getResponse().setBody(newDoc);
            }
        );
        if (!accepted) return;
    }
    ```

    > Inside the JavaScript callback, users can either handle the exception or throw an error. In case a callback is not provided and there is an error, the Azure Cosmos DB runtime throws an error. This stored procedures creates a new document and uses a nested callback function to return the document as the body of the response.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``contosoairlines``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button.

    1. In the new field that appears, enter the value: ``{ "company": "contosoairlines", "industry": "travel" }``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe the results of the stored procedure's execution.

    > You should see a new document in your Container. Azure Cosmos DB has assigned additional fields to the document such as ``id`` and ``_etag``.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM investors WHERE investors.company = "contosoairlines" AND investors.industry = "travel"
    ```

    > This query will retrieve the document you have just created.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. Close the **Query** tab.

### Create Stored Procedure with Logging

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **createDocumentWithLogging**.

1. Replace the contents of the *stored procedure editor* with the following JavaScript code:

    ```js
    function createDocumentWithLogging(doc) {
        console.log("procedural-start ");
        var context = getContext();
        var Container = context.getContainer();
        console.log("metadata-retrieved ");
        var accepted = Container.createDocument(
            Container.getSelfLink(),
            doc,
            function (err, newDoc) {
                console.log("callback-started ");
                if (err) throw new Error('Error' + err.message);
                context.getResponse().setBody(newDoc.id);
            }
        );
        console.log("async-doc-creation-started ");
        if (!accepted) return;
        console.log("procedural-end");
    }
    ```

    > This stored procedure will use the **console.log** feature that's normally used in browser-based JavaScript to write output to the console. In the context of Azure Cosmos DB, this feature can be used to capture diagnostics logging information that can be returned after the stored procedure is executed.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``contosoairlines``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button.

    1. In the new field that appears, enter the value: ``{ "company": "contosoairlines" }``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe the results of the stored procedure's execution.

    > You should see the unique id of a new document in your Container.

1. Click the *console.log* link in the **Result** pane to view the log data for your stored procedure execution.

    > You can see that the procedural components of the stored procedure finished first and then the callback function was executed once the document was created. This can help you understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript callbacks.

### Create Stored Procedure with Callback Functions

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **createDocumentWithFunction**.

1. Replace the contents of the *stored procedure editor* with the following JavaScript code:

    ```js
    function createDocumentWithFunction(document) {
        var context = getContext();
        var Container = context.getContainer();
        if (!Container.createDocument(Container.getSelfLink(), document, documentCreated))
            return;
        function documentCreated(error, newDocument) {
            if (error) throw new Error('Error' + error.message);
            context.getResponse().setBody(newDocument);
        }
    }
    ```

    > This is the same stored procedure as you created previously but it is using a named function instead of an implicit callback function inline.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``adventureworks``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button.

    1. In the new field that appears, enter the value: ``{ "company": "contosoairlines" }``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe that the stored procedure execution has failed.

    > Stored procedures are bound to a specific partition key. In this example, tried to execute the stored procedure within the context of the **adventureworks** partition key. Within the stored procedure, we tried to create a new document using the **contosoairlines** partition key. The stored procedure was unable to create a new document (or access existing documents) in a partition key other than the one specified when the stored procedure is executed. This caused the stored procedure to fail. You are not able to create or manipulate documents across partition keys within a stored procedure. 

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``adventureworks``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button.

    1. In the new field that appears, enter the value: ``{ "company": "adventureworks" }``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe the results of the stored procedure's execution.

    > You should see a new document in your Container. Azure Cosmos DB has assigned additional fields to the document such as ``id`` and ``_etag``.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM investors WHERE investors.company = "adventureworks"
    ```

    > This query will retrieve the document you have just created.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. Close the **Query** tab.

### Create Stored Procedure with Error Handling

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **createTwoDocuments**.

        var context = getContext();
        var Container = context.getContainer();
        var firstDocument = {
            company: companyName,
            industry: industry
        };
        var secondDocument = {
            company: companyName,
            tax: {
                exempt: false,
                rate: taxRate
            }
        };
        var firstAccepted = Container.createDocument(Container.getSelfLink(), firstDocument, 
            function (firstError, newFirstDocument) {
                if (firstError) throw new Error('Error' + firstError.message);
                var secondAccepted = Container.createDocument(Container.getSelfLink(), secondDocument,
                    function (secondError, newSecondDocument) {
                        if (secondError) throw new Error('Error' + secondError.message);      
                        context.getResponse().setBody({
                            companyRecord: newFirstDocument,
                            taxRecord: newSecondDocument
                        });
                    }
                );
                if (!secondAccepted) return;    
            }
        );
        if (!firstAccepted) return;    
    }
    ```

    ```js
    function createTwoDocuments(companyName, industry, taxRate) {
        var context = getContext();
        var Container = context.getContainer();
        var firstDocument = {
            company: companyName,
            industry: industry
        };
        var secondDocument = {
            company: companyName + "_taxprofile",
            tax: {
                exempt: false,
                rate: taxRate
            }
        };
        var firstAccepted = Container.createDocument(Container.getSelfLink(), firstDocument, 
            function (firstError, newFirstDocument) {
                if (firstError) throw new Error('Error' + firstError.message);
                console.log('Created: ' + newFirstDocument.id);
                var secondAccepted = Container.createDocument(Container.getSelfLink(), secondDocument,
                    function (secondError, newSecondDocument) {
                        if (secondError) throw new Error('Error' + secondError.message); 
                        console.log('Created: ' + newSecondDocument.id);                   
                        context.getResponse().setBody({
                            companyRecord: newFirstDocument,
                            taxRecord: newSecondDocument
                        });
                    }
                );
                if (!secondAccepted) return;    
            }
        );
        if (!firstAccepted) return;    
    }
    ```

    > Transactions are deeply and natively integrated into Cosmos DB’s JavaScript programming model. Inside a JavaScript function, all operations are automatically wrapped under a single transaction. If the JavaScript completes without any exception, the operations to the database are committed. We are going to change the stored procedure to put in a different company name for the second document. This should cause the stored procedure to fail since the second document uses a different partition key. If there is any exception that’s propagated from the script, Cosmos DB’s JavaScript runtime will roll back the whole transaction. This will effectively ensure that the first or second documents are not commited to the database.

1. Click the **Update** button at the top of the tab.

1. Click the **Execute** button at the top of the tab.

1. In the **Input parameters** popup that appears, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Partition key value** field, enter the value: ``jetsonairways``.
    
    1. Click the **Add New Param** button three times.

    1. In the first field that appears, enter the value: ``jetsonairways``.

    1. In the second field that appears, enter the value: ``travel``.

    1. In the third field that appears, enter the value: ``1.15``.

    1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. In the **Result** pane at the bottom of the tab, observe that the stored procedure execution has failed.

    > This stored procedure failed to create the second document so the entire transaction was rolled back.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM investors WHERE investors.company = "jetsonairways"
    ```

    > This query won't retrieve any documents since the transaction was rolled back.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. Close the **Query** tab.

## Author Stored Procedures using the Continuation Model

*You will now implement stored procedures that may execute longer than the bounded execution limits on the server. You will implement the continuation model so that the stored procedures can "pick up where they left off" after they ran out of time in a previous execution.*

### Create Bulk Upload and Bulk Delete Stored Procedures

1. Click the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **bulkUpload**.

    function bulkUpload(docs) {
        var Container = getContext().getContainer();
        var ContainerLink = Container.getSelfLink();
        var count = 0;
        if (!docs) throw new Error("The array is undefined or null.");
        var docsLength = docs.length;
        if (docsLength == 0) {
            getContext().getResponse().setBody(0);
            return;
        }
        tryCreate(docs[count], callback);
        function tryCreate(doc, callback) {
            var isAccepted = Container.createDocument(ContainerLink, doc, callback);
            if (!isAccepted) getContext().getResponse().setBody(count);
        }
        function callback(err, doc, options) {
            if (err) throw err;
            count++;
            if (count >= docsLength) {
                getContext().getResponse().setBody(count);
            } else {
                tryCreate(docs[count], callback);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > This stored procedure uploads an array of documents in one batch. If the entire batch is not completed, the stored procedure will set the response body to the number of documents that were imported.

1. From the options that appear, select "maven-archetype-quickstart", and then select the directory you created for the project when prompted. Maven will then prompt you to provide values for group id, artifact id, version, package. Fill these in when prompted and then confirm:

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/maven2.jpg)


1. Once confirmed, Maven will create the project, and provide a sample App.java. For any Java class created in the project, VS Code's Java Extension will provide "run" and "debug" links directly in the code. Clicking "run" will compile and run your Java code:

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/maven3.jpg)


1. To add the Maven project dependancies required to work with Cosmos DB, you should add the following into the pom.xml file located at the bottom of your project, within the dependancies section:

    ```xml
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
      <artifactId>azure-cosmosdb</artifactId>
      <version>2.4.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

1. For this tutorial, you will also need to change the source and target compiler versions to Java 1.8, as we will use some lambda syntax which is only supported from Java 8 onwards. When finished, your pom.xml should look like the below:

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/maven4.jpg)


1. Once the changes are applied, ensure you click file -> save all. At this point, VS Code will recognise that you modified the pom.xml build file. Ensure that you accept the prompt to sync the dependancies:

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/maven6.jpg)

    > Once the dependencies are pulled down, you will be ready to start writing Java code for Cosmos DB.

### Create AsyncDocumentClient Instance and Database

*The AsyncDocumentClient class is the main "entry point" to using the SQL API in Azure Cosmos DB. We are going to create an instance of the **AsyncDocumentClient** class by passing in connection metadata as parameters of the class' constructor. We will then use this class instance throughout the lab.*

1. To help generate random data in the documents, we are going to use a java library called "javafaker", which was also used in an earlier lab. If not already done so, you will need to add the following to your pom.xml file, located at the bottom of your project, within the dependancies section (ensure you accept the "synchronize the Java classpath/configuration" warning if you have not accepted this permanently):

 ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>com.github.javafaker</groupId>
         <artifactId>javafaker</artifactId>
         <version>0.17.2</version>
     </dependency>  
 ```

1. At the same level as the default "App.java" file that already exists, right click and create a new file called "Person.java" . The editor will automatically open this file. Copy in the following code (be sure that the package declaration matches the classpath you have created in the above steps):

    ```java
    package test;

    import java.text.DecimalFormat;
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.Random;

    import com.github.javafaker.Faker;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.Document;

    public class Person {
        Faker faker = new Faker();
        ArrayList<Object> documentDefinitions = new ArrayList<>();  
        public Person(int number) throws NumberFormatException {
            for (int i= 0; i < number;i++){  
                Document documentDefinition = new Document();          
                documentDefinition.set("firstName", faker.name().firstName());
                documentDefinition.set("lastName", faker.name().lastName());
                documentDefinition.set("company", "contosofinancial");
                String docdef = documentDefinition.toString();
                documentDefinitions.add(docdef);
            }    
        }
    }
    ```


1. Create a new file called "Program.java" (or delete the contents of the existing file if already created)

1. Within the **Program.java** editor tab, Add the package declaration (which will need to match the path you created for your maven project, if not "test" as in the sample shown here) and the following imports to the top of the editor:

    ```java
    package test;
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.ConnectionPolicy;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.ConsistencyLevel;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.DocumentContainer;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.PartitionKey;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.RequestOptions;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.rx.AsyncDocumentClient;
    import rx.Scheduler;
    import rx.schedulers.Schedulers;

    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.ConnectionMode;
    import com.microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.Document;
    import java.util.UUID;
    
    ```

1. Create a **Program** class in the Program.java file as below, with the following class variables, a public constructor and main method:

    ```java
    public class Program 
    {

        public Program() {
            //public constructor

        }
        public static void main( String[] args )
        {
 
        }
    }
    ```

1. Within the **Program** class, add the following lines of code to create variables for your connection information:

    ```java
        private final ExecutorService executorService;
        private final Scheduler scheduler;
        private AsyncDocumentClient client;

        private final String databaseName = "FinancialDatabase";
        private final String ContainerId = "InvestorContainer";
    ```



1. Locate the **Program** class constructor:

    ```java
        public Program() {
            //public constructor

        }
    ```

1. Within the constructor, add the following lines of code (replacing "uri" and "key" with the values from your cosmos db account):

    ```java
        public Program() {
            //public constructor
            executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);
            scheduler = Schedulers.from(executorService);
            client = new AsyncDocumentClient.Builder().withServiceEndpoint("uri")
            .withMasterKeyOrResourceToken("key")
            .withConnectionPolicy(ConnectionPolicy.GetDefault()).withConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.Eventual)
            .build();
        }
    ```
    > We are now going to implement a stored procedure.

### Execute Bulk Upload Stored Procedure from Async Java SDK

1. Below the **Main** method, add the following method to execute the bulkUpload stored procedure:

    ```java
    public void executeStoredProc() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("creating documents");
        ArrayList<Object> documents = new Person(500).documentDefinitions;
        RequestOptions requestOptions = new RequestOptions();
        requestOptions.setScriptLoggingEnabled(true);
        requestOptions.setPartitionKey(new PartitionKey("contosofinancial"));      
        final CountDownLatch successfulCompletionLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        String sprocLink = "dbs/" + databaseName + "/colls/" + ContainerId + "/sprocs/bulkUpload"; 
        // Execute the stored procedure
        Object docs = documents.toArray();
        Object[] storedProcedureArgs = new Object[]{docs};
        client.executeStoredProcedure(sprocLink, requestOptions, storedProcedureArgs)
                .subscribe(storedProcedureResponse -> {
                    String storedProcResultAsString = storedProcedureResponse.getResponseAsString();
                    successfulCompletionLatch.countDown();
                    System.out.println(storedProcedureResponse.getActivityId());
                }, error -> {
                    System.err.println("an error occurred while executing the stored procedure: actual cause: "
                                               + error.getMessage());
                });
        successfulCompletionLatch.await();        

    }
    ```

1. Locate the **Main** method:

    ```java
        public static void main( String[] args )
        {

        }
    ```

1. Within the **Main** method, add the following code:


    ```java
        Program p = new Program();

        try {
            p.executeStoredProc();
            System.out.println("finished");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println(String.format("failed with %s", e));
        } 
        System.exit(0);
    ```


1. Your ``Program`` class definition should now look like this:

    ```java
        public class Program {

            private final ExecutorService executorService;
            private final Scheduler scheduler;
            private AsyncDocumentClient client;

            private final String databaseName = "FinancialDatabase";
            private final String ContainerId = "InvestorContainer";


            public Program() {
                executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);
                scheduler = Schedulers.from(executorService);
                // Sets up the requirements for each test
                ConnectionPolicy connectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy();
                connectionPolicy.setConnectionMode(ConnectionMode.Direct);
                client = new AsyncDocumentClient.Builder()
                        .withServiceEndpoint("uri")
                        .withMasterKeyOrResourceToken("key")
                        .withConnectionPolicy(connectionPolicy)
                        .withConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.Session)
                        .build();

                DocumentContainer ContainerDefinition = new DocumentContainer();
                ContainerDefinition.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
            
            }

            /**
            * Create a document with a programmatically set definition, in an Async manner
            */


            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SPProgram p = new Program();

                try {
                    p.executeStoredProc();
                    System.out.println("finished");

                } catch (Exception e) {
                    System.err.println(String.format("failed with %s", e));
                } 
                System.exit(0);

            }     
            public void executeStoredProc() throws Exception {
                System.out.println("creating documents");
                ArrayList<Object> documents = new Person(500).documentDefinitions;
                RequestOptions requestOptions = new RequestOptions();
                requestOptions.setScriptLoggingEnabled(true);
                requestOptions.setPartitionKey(new PartitionKey("contosofinancial"));            
                final CountDownLatch successfulCompletionLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
                String sprocLink = "dbs/" + databaseName + "/colls/" + ContainerId + "/sprocs/bulkUpload"; 
                // Execute the stored procedure
                Object docs = documents.toArray();
                Object[] storedProcedureArgs = new Object[]{docs};
                client.executeStoredProcedure(sprocLink, requestOptions, storedProcedureArgs)
                        .subscribe(storedProcedureResponse -> {
                            String storedProcResultAsString = storedProcedureResponse.getResponseAsString();
                            successfulCompletionLatch.countDown();
                            System.out.println(storedProcedureResponse.getActivityId());
                        }, error -> {
                            System.err.println("an error occurred while executing the stored procedure: actual cause: "
                                                    + error.getMessage());
                        });
                successfulCompletionLatch.await();        

            }
        }
